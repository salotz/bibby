* Bibby

Bibby is just a cli and little python library for doing useful things
with the bibsonomy API.

Right now there is enough for fetching you current citations and
writing it to a file and nothing else.

Requires:
- bibsonomy
- Click - for cli
- Pybtex

** Installation

Use the dev one for now:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/salotz/bibby.git
#+END_SRC

Since it is a command line application I suggest using ~pipx~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pipx install git+https://github.com/salotz/bibby.git
#+END_SRC

You can retrieve your publications using:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bibby fetch $USERNAME $API_TOKEN $BIB_PATH
#+END_SRC

** Goals 

- [ ] Storing users and tokens securely
